Develop the code in Arduino to interface an LM35 temperature sensor (Assume the sensor is connected to Arduino Analog pin A0) with an Arduino Uno and control the onboard LED based on temperature readings: 
Interface the LM35 temperature sensor with an Arduino Uno. 
When the temperature falls below 30 degrees Celsius, make the onboard LED blink every 250 milliseconds.
If the temperature rises above 30 degrees Celsius, make the onboard LED blink every 500 milliseconds.
Note :-  You are not supposed use Millis(), delay() and micros() function and you can use any library to perform this task.
